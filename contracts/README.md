# How to Setup Foundry and Write a Basic Unit Test

## Setup Foundry

Using an existing Hedera node project with the JavaScript SDK, learn how to set up Foundry to be able to leverage [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/), their command-line tool, to run your smart contract tests written in Solidity. 

## What you will accomplish

- ✅ Configure Foundry and Forge with a Hedera Project
- ✅ Write unit tests in Solidity
- ✅ Run your tests using Foundry `forge` command
- ✅ Create a Forge Gas Report
